# plugins/local

These are general local customizations for the ArchivesSpace instance at Special Collections and Archives at the University Libraries, University of Denver. They do three things:

1. Branding
2. Extend the resource_tree content model to display the component IDs in the third column, for easier tree navigation for our archivists
3. Add rows to the component toolbar for Archival Objects to allow for MODS export and linking to digital objects, provided the [ao_mods](https://github.com/duspeccoll/ao_mods) and [item_linker](https://github.com/duspeccoll/item_linker) plugins are active
4. Custom MARC export options (with many thanks to the work done at [NYU](https://github.com/NYULibraries/nyu_marcxml_export_plugin) and [Dartmouth](https://github.com/hudmol/dartmouth_udf_exports) for leading the way)

Customizations to the public user interface (PUI) may be found in a separate plugin documented [here](https://github.com/duspeccoll/denver_pui).
